Bao taught English as a Second Language in Vietnam to local students at Vung Tau Community College, covering basic to pre-intermediate levels. Since coming to Australia he has successfully drawn on his skills, knowledge and experience as a language teacher to teach Vietnamese. 

In his lessons, Bao uses instructions in both Vietnamese and English in order for students to gain the most out of activities. He considers studentsâ€™ individual objectives in learning Vietnamese, as well as their past experience with the language, incorporating this into expertly catered lesson plans.

Bao has travelled extensively in Vietnam and is keen to introduce students to the major attractions of his homeland, as well as provide some insight into life off the tourist route.
