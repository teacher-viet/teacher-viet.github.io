I taught English as a Second Language in Vietnam to local students at Vung Tau Community College, covering basic to pre-intermediate levels. Since coming to Australia I have successfully drawn on my skills, knowledge and experience as a language teacher to teach Vietnamese. 

In my lessons, I use instructions in both Vietnamese and English in order for students to gain the most out of activities. I consider studentsâ€™ individual objectives in learning Vietnamese, as well as their past experience with the language, incorporating this into expertly catered lesson plans.

I have travelled extensively in Vietnam and I am keen to introduce students to the major attractions of my homeland, as well as provide some insight into life off the tourist route.
